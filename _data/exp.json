Internship, built a Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow based Machine-Learning pipeline for classification of LOS/NLOS 5G and GNSS signal to further enhance positioning algorithm accuracy. Created Jupyter notebooks for ML-pipeline and documented data preprocessing. Performed ANOVA testing and PCA for feature selection. Migrated code for Kalman filter from MATLAB into python and ran unit-tests to verify and debug code execution.",
